I'm a passionate data scientist and Python developer with a fascination for artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Throughout my professional journey, I've worked as a data analyst, data scientist, and Python developer, and I've had the opportunity to delve into the exciting world of web 3.0 and blockchain.

## 💼 Professional Experience

My experience spans a wide range of projects, from developing complete blockchain-based applications for traceability in the timber sector to creating artificial intelligence algorithms for the European Union. I have worked with frameworks like Django and Flask, and I also have expertise in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and other programming languages.

## 👨‍💻 Passion for Artificial Intelligence

What excites me the most in my work is artificial intelligence and how these technologies can complement and enhance human abilities. I enjoy creating and building projects with complete freedom, which has allowed me to develop my skills as a machine learning engineer and data scientist expert.

## 🌱 A Touch of Humor and Ambition to Learn

Once I faced the challenge of translating a project written in the Vue framework to Python, a real challenge! However, my communication skills and ambition to keep learning led me to overcome it successfully. These abilities make me a technical professional capable of managing projects and collaborating with different teams.

## 🌊 Beyond Code

When I'm not immersed in the world of programming and data, I love enjoying the outdoors. I am an animal lover and passionate about contributing to the planet in that aspect. Additionally, you can find me engaging in activities like caving, canyoning, paragliding, jet skiing, and exploring nature and mountains. The sea and water are my favorite places to recharge.
